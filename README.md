# Frontend Coding Challenge: TaskMaster Dashboard

Welcome to the Frontend Coding Challenge! This test is designed to assess your skills in building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using **React** and **TypeScript**.

## The Task
Your goal is to build a Task Management Dashboard. Imagine this is a simplified version of Jira or Trello. Users should be able to view tasks, filter them, and manage their status.

We have provided a basic Vite + React + TypeScript scaffolding. It is up to you to structure the application, manage state, and style the UI.

## Requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements
- **Task List**: Fetch and display tasks from the provided mock API (`/tasks.json`).
    - *Note*: We have included a `public/tasks.json` file with 100 tasks. You can fetch this using `fetch('/tasks.json')`.
- **Filtering & Search**:
    - Filter tasks by status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
    - Search tasks by title.
- **Task Management**:
    - Ability to add a new task (Simulate this, doesn't need to persist to file).
    - Ability to delete a task.
    - Ability to toggle status.
- **Pagination (Bonus)**: Since there are 100 tasks, display them in pages (e.g., 10 per page) rather than a long list.

### 2. Technical Constraints
- **Framework**: React 19+ (Hooks are mandatory).
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict mode enabled. Avoid `any`).
- **Styling**: You may use **TailwindCSS** (preferred), CSS Modules, or Styled Components. Please do *not* use full component libraries (e.g., MaterialUI, AntD, Chakra) as we want to see how you build and style components.
- **State Management**: Use React Context, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or TanStack Query. Explain your choice in the PR description or comments.

### 3. Design & UX (The "Wow" Factor)
- The application should look modern and premium (think 2026 standards).
- Use smooth transitions/animations where appropriate.
- Ensure the app is responsive (mobile-friendly).
- Accessibility (a11y) is important.

## AI Usage Policy (Strict)
We embrace modern tools, but we are hiring *you*, not your AI assistant.
- **Allowed**: Using AI to explain concepts, generate mock data, or debug cryptic errors.
- **FORBIDDEN**: Copy-pasting entire blocks of code generated by a prompt like "Write me a React task app".

## Submission
1. Clone this repository (do not fork).
2. **Create a new branch** named `assessment/[your-name]`.
3. Complete the task.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch.
5. In your PR description, explain:
    - Your architecture decisions.
    - Any trade-offs you made.
    - How to run your project (if extra steps are needed).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your work.
